{{ site.description }}

Content posted here constitutes a singular project between January and May 2018.

**Project sources and Github repository:**

* [`master`](https://github.com/winstonjay/digitalcitizens), for code files, jupyter notebooks and other supporting materials.
* [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/winstonjay/digitalcitizens/tree/gh-pages), for blog content files.

This site is a static site generated by [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and served using Github pages. The default theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) is being used.

**Contact**

I havent left an email address but if your would like to get in touch, notice any mistakes or anything like that feel free to [open a issue via github](https://github.com/winstonjay/digitalcitizens/issues/new).

**Archive of this page**

On a bit of a side-line, I have been using this page to prototype creating version archives of GitHub pages. Below are all the different version histories that were created. Now, as some of the content is more dynamically generated, it is the same across multiple versions. For instance, the archive table once it appears in the template, will always be the current archive. Its basically the equivilent of reading the [source history](https://github.com/winstonjay/digitalcitizens/commits/gh-pages/pages/about.md) of this file but getting jekyll to re-render it.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Created</th>
        <th>commit.file</th>
        <th>Commit comment</th>
    </tr>
    {% for entry in site.data.history %}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ entry.created }}</td>
        <td><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ entry.src }}">{{ entry.id }}</a></td>
        <td>{{ entry.comment }}</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
