Presenting a series of forthcoming posts related to the recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, an introduction is made to the investigation whilst chronicling its aims ahead.

The scandal involving Cambridge Analytica’s apparent miss-use of Facebook data is an especially relevant piece of current affairs for an investigation of contemporary civic issues. It belongs to the wider issues surrounding data regulations, the economic foundations of web 2.0 and normative democratic ideals.

**TODO**: continue introduction.

## The plan

Instead of cramming everything in a single post like what has been done previously, this article will be split into four parts. These will try to be more concise and purposeful than the previously written.

The sections planned, including this current post, can be outlined and summarised as follows:

**Part 1: Introduction**

You are here. This will be whatever this page is right now.

**Part 2: Twitter reactions to Facebooks ‘data leak’**

Initial reactions made via twitter will be studied whilst experimenting with word embedding’s. This aims to map contextual relationships within the response.

**Part 3: The Guardian’s story**

**Part 4: Further analysis and theoretical considerations**
