# Content Analyser

An interface for human content analysis (currently Youtube comments).

This is in no way finished, or really currently usable. If you have a json file of with a list of Youtube comment threads and link in the `examplebook.csv` file in accordance with the command-line args it might do. There isnt any security or anything like that implemented yet either.
