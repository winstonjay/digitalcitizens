##Â Text tools
This folder contains scripts for pre-processing data and some implementations of some NLP algorithms. Some notable files:

* `rake.py` - Implements the RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm.
* `chain.py` - Implements a basic Markov chain text generation algorithm.
* `spamfilter.py` - a Hashtag based twitter spam filter.
* `word2vec_basic.py` - Word to Vector algorithm, file taken from Tensorflow tutorial. Alterations made to suit my needs. Makes nice t-SNE graph from the input data.

The unlisted files are mainly just the data pre-processing scripts.
