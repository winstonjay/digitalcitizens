## Resources
This folder contains a number of static resources script files.

* `badwords.txt` - list of English swear words, insult words etc. compiled from various resources over extended time period. Some are just silly tbh.
* `stopwords.txt` - list of English stop words to exclude from text compiled from various sources over extended time period. Think it includes NLTK's list.
* `more_stopwords.txt` - Same as `stopwords.txt` just more. Main additions are from reuters_wos.txt file found in this repo: https://github.com/igorbrigadir/stopwords . This collection was made more with news articles in mind.
* `youtube_topic_ids.csv` - Reference for Topic id's for YouTubes search API.
